        <p class="body-copy" style="padding-right: 64px;"> The Golden Record project is an educational
            B5 tri-fold brochure created for NASA’s outreach program, targeting students
            aged 14–18. It introduces the story of the Golden Record — the phonograph record
            launched aboard the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft nearly fifty years ago — carrying
            sounds, images, and messages about life on Earth to the unknown reaches of space.
            <br><br>
            The brochure explains the Voyager missions and the cultural significance of sending
            a message from humanity to the universe. Scientific and historical details were
            distilled into clear, engaging visuals and concise text so that young readers
            can easily grasp both the technical achievement and the imaginative vision behind
            the mission.
            <br><br>
            The design combines educational clarity and visual storytelling, using a progressive
            tri-fold structure, deep-space imagery, and a clean information hierarchy. It guides
            readers from the launch of the spacecraft to the contents of the record, ending with
            a reflection on what it means to present humanity’s story to the cosmos.
